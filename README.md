Basic Calculator. But more intelligent than some people I have met... :D

This project started out as an idea of making a parody calculator tool which would troll the user as they tried to use it.
It turned out that building a basic calculator was harder than I thought for a fledgling Python coder like myself.
This then turned into a challenge to just get the thing working first as a basic calculator.

I would not recommend you use this calculator for your final year calculus exam, however it should suffice for basic mathematical challenges:
  - add up the number of pencils on your desk and then getting the square root thereof.
  - show your mom that 1 + 2 is indeed 3.
  - See if you can divide by 0.
  - just waste time you could have been spending playing something else. :)
  
On a serious note, this project was more fun than I thought it would be. I have learned an immense amount building this. I would encourage you to also try building a calculator app if you just started coding.
I used the Pygame library to do this as I am currently also working through a book on using Pygame. There are most probably far superior libraries out there to use, but I have not yet looked into it.

Feel free to copy and play with the code. Please let me know if you have any comments on how I could have done things differently.

Known issues:
  - I have not sorted out the percentage function yet. Click the percentage key at your own risk.
 
Future plans:
  - Add exponent funtionality
  - add Readout * e^x functionality so calculations with larger numbers can be done
  - Add Pi
  - Still create a fork with the parody calculator I originally wanted to build (depending if I do not find something more productive do code)

P.S: The code_playground.py file can be ignored. I just created it to test out concepts if I do not want to mess around with my main code.
